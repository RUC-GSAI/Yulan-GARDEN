## Download
You can down load ElasticSearch from https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/elasticsearch into this folder.
In our implementation, we use elasticsearch-7.13.2-linux-x86_64.

## Quick Start
You need to start the ElasticSearch engine before processing datasets. Run the following command in the Yulan-GARDEN directory:
```
bash utils/retriever/es_start.sh
```
